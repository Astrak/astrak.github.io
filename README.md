Showcase

This repository gathers my WebGL projects and serves them on a github page. 

I also use it to test development code on mobile, so it is not supposed to have a dev branch. 

For this reason this repository is of course updated for stable releases but also for unstable ones : do not expect everything to work on every platform.
